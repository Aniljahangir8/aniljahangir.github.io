## INTERESTS

Apart from being a DevOps, I also learn to automate my work using many technologies such as plasticscm, docker, Selenium, and others.

I adore being outside and go for a run every day, play cricket and badminton on weekends, and cycle on occasionally. I enjoy visiting new places and learning about different cultures. When I'm at home, I like to play video games, create code, and sometimes paint.
